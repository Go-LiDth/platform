    (other than browserplus.js) from 2.9.2 to 2.9.7.

06/18/2010 - Changes from 2.9.3 to 2.9.4
  * Another small fix for Safari 5 on 10.6 64-bit.  in browserplus.js
    when we detect and block BrowserPlus < 2.9.2 from runninng on
    Safari 5, we'll also invoke require (for a platform built-in service)
    to trigger update logic and install a newer platform which addresses
    the bugs causing us to block in the first place.

06/17/2010 - Changes from 2.9.2 to 2.9.3
  * Disable safari 5 on 10.6 for platforms < 2.9.2 in browserplus.js.

    re-install rather than being subject to browser lockup caused by
    FileBrowse's modal dialog under Safari 5.

06/10/2010 - Changes from 2.9.1 to 2.9.2

    generation time - offline)

    cause of failures in the field.
  * bug #51 - -version flag added to servicerunner    
  * on win32 config panel we now wait for daemon to shut down before invoking uninstaller.
  * bugfix #34 - no longer does any software linked against libraries from a specific platform
    version drop a bunch of directories all over the place.

    "broken", and subsequently "fixed"

  * fix issue where on OSX plugin might not be removed on uninstall
  * several fixes in logging which could cause corrupted logfiles

  * remove console.log() inside HTML5 dnd code (snow leopard/safari)
  * improved logging around crashed services
  * Installation id now persistent across platform updates

07/27/2009 - Changes from 2.4.10 to 2.4.11
  * [bug 2908279] [bug 2911972] Perform update immediately rather than waiting for
    BrowserPlusCore to shut down.  This improves the testability of the system, and
    is inline with user expectation.  Despite the magnitude of this change, the
    code to complete the update code is distributed with a new platform version, so
    getting this code in NOW allows for QA to meaningfully test the update
    experience that will hit end users several months from now, and addresses
    several open bugs and sources of confusion.

  * [bug 2822728] Fix "thumbnails not showing up in windows" - ImageAlter stopped working because of an accidental change in the service API, where windows paths for data_dir and corelet_dir were passed with forward slashes instead of back slashes.  This regression was related to our move to boost file system abstractions introduced in 2.4.0.
  * [bug 2821822] ServiceInstaller.exe (a developer tool shipped in the bpsdk) was causing a UAC prompt and trying to escalate on Vista and above.  Vista tries to escalate by default when it sees 'Installer' in the filename of an executable.  ServiceInstaller.exe will no longer try to escalate unnecesarily.

04/21/2008 - Changes from 1.0.2 to 1.1.0
  * UI Improvements, all user prompts are now HTML for greater consistency,
    appearance, and flexibility.
  * Prompting from Corelets is fully supported, allowing corelet authors
    to craft their own secure prompting to the end user.
  * Internationalization support: A locale may be provided to
    BrowserPlus.init() (aka YAHOO.bp.init()) which will cause all user
    visible strings to be generated in the language specified, provided
    translations are available.
  * "core" service removed.  This was mainly a user-visible implementation
    artifact, and has now been removed
  * "InactiveServices" built-in corelet added.  This allows querying of
    (potentially multiple) distributions services from javascript
  * Platform self-update:  In the same way that corelet updates are
    downloaded in the background, now new platform versions are downloaded.
    The user is prompted inline with the service install dialog.
    Outside of catastrophes, the user should have to endure initial install
    experience only once. 
  * Massive performance enhancements: much time has been spent optimizing
    the startup time of browserplus.  now on the order of 60ms depending on
    the client machine.  A large number of locally installed corelets have 
    a much less detrimental effect on performance.
  * Complete JS API rework.  These are API BREAKING changes which result
    from much reviewing and stressing of the browserplus API.  YAHOO.bp is
    now the supported top level namespace, though a deprecated alias to
    window.BrowserPlus exists.
  * Infamous "pidfile" removed, replaces with more sophisticated os specific
    mechanisms.  Platform is much more resistant to multiple
    instances of the BrowserPlus daemon.
  * Installation is System scoped on Windows.  BrowserPlus now is installed
    in Program Files and appears in the "Add Remove Programs" dialog.
    Installation is still user-scoped on Darwin to reduce security risk.
  * Partial Firefox 3 support (uncertain wether full support will be in
    initial external release, or will come as an update later.  Massive
    behavioral changis in FFX beta (which we call and report as BUGS)
    are the holdup)..
  * Refactoring, Build system improvements, and Bug fixes, large and small.

    we still support that) use bpclient:// scheme
  * periodic corelet update with poll period in configuration file
  * corelet blacklisting support
  * Allow 'any' to be specified as type for corelet arguments
  * Corelets now have access to URL from which webpage accessing corelet
    is served.
  * Partial internationalization implementation (mechanism to pass locale
    to corelet)
  * Corelet persistence support.  Corelets passed 'data_dir' at instantiation
    time that they may store files to.  This data will persist between
    sessions, and is scoped to coreletname, major version number.  today,
    corelets are responsible for handling data migration, because corelets
    completely control disk representation.
  * Corelet temporary file support.  Corelets passed temp_dir which contains
    a directory where temporary files may be stored.  This directory will
    be purged at the end of the session. 
  * User prompting support, both EULA display and user prompting from
    corelets.  Added to Corelet API.
  * full support for UTF8 corelet names.
  * signing support throughout.  Both for corelets and for "permissions",
    which are site whitelists, platform whitelists, and corelet blacklists
  * "killswitch support", aka platform whitelist
  * Pluglet impelmentation: in-plugin services that provide a cross browser,
    cross platform API
  * Drag and Drop moved into a Pluglet, now API is documented through online
    help
  * FileBrowse service (pluglet) added for native file browse dialogs.
  * Massive cleanup of browserplus.js, lots of functionality moved into plugin.
  * Moved from local TCP to Named Pipes/Stream pipes.

    of milestone number
  * Addition of BPTPath (path) which supports secure file representation
    throughout the system
  * BrowserPlusCore shuts down after n (5 by default) seconds of inactivity
  * Multiple windows Vista fixes.
  * Callbacks working for synchronous JS function invocation on all
    supported browser/platform combinations.
  * VS runtime installed _before_ regserver is run in installer, fixing
    initial install problems on windows for systems where visual studio
    nor the runtime has been installed. 
  * Changes to corelet API and BrowserPlusCore to support "dependent"
    corelets and "provider" corelets.  This allows the authoring of
    intepreter corelets and high level language corelets on top of
    these.  
  * manifest.json for corelets must now provide a 'type' key with one of
    'standalone', 'provider', or 'dependent' values.  Additionally the
    manifest.json may contain type dependent keys.  Old style native
    corelets should have a type of 'standalone'
  * Fix unfiled bugs in dynamic detection of updated corelets
  * The timestamp on manifest.json in the user scoped corelet directory
    is the date used to determine if corelet reload is neccesary
  * lightweight 'yajl' library preferred over heavyweight 'DRV' library
    for most JSON parsing in system
  * BrowserPlusCore now refuses to load corelets with unsupported corelet
    API versions (previous behavior was to not check, and crash)
  * Installation is now platform version scoped to allow transparent
    update in the future
  * Corelets are passed parameters at initialization time to inform of
    information such as the directory into which the corelet is installed
  * CoreletPublisher & CoreletValidator handle dependent corelets
  * Changes to web services API to support more efficient querying and
    dependent corelets

    boundary
  * feedback on corelet API integrated (breaking changes):
    + updated documentation
    + return of error codes removed to remove redundancy
    + useless parameters removed

06/26/2007 - Changes from M1 to M1.1
  * everything we ship links against release runtimes on win32,  allows
    win32 executables to run on machines without visual studio installed.
  * ship vcredist_x86.exe in our SDK.   
  * allow callbacks as function arguments.  This allows the incremental
    return of results from long running corelet operations. (i.e. upload
    status, desktop search)
  * YahooFinance corelet returns more company information.
  * DesktopSearch corelet incrementally returns results as they become
    available.
  * honor "type" argument in DesktopSearch corelet.
  * fix JSON escaping bug which would disallow newlines and other control
    chars in return values from corelets.
  * fix bug which would prevent corelets from being reloaded without
    restarting BrowserPlusCore
  * fix bug which would cause corelets to be initialized twice.
  * improve locking granularity to allow work to be enqueued while a 
    corelet function is executing.
  * fix error return codes, don't prepend corelet name twice for
    dynamic corelets.  
  * add BrowserPlus.cancelTransaction, allowing an async transaction
    to be canceled (no callbacks will be called)
