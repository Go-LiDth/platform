A terse document describing the repository structure

Rules (Because "form is liberating"):
  1. no upper case dirs
  2. tree will be structured functionally
  3. only use "src" where there are other non-src peers 
     (e.g. docs, legal)
  4. Where does a binary go:
    a. 'bins holds bins installed on users' machines
    b. 'sdk' holds bins which ship in one of our sdks    
    c. 'support' holds things required to build/ship the product  
    d. all other binaries go in tools

Software Organization:

    /docs           - documents, like this one
    /legal          - legal documents 
    /src            - source code
    /src/support    - scripts, localization files... stuff used to
                      build the software  
    /src/javascript - javascript code that is "part of" the platform but
                      is distributed separately from it (usually on a CDN)
    /src/plugins    - browser specific plugins
    /src/tools      - source for binaries used for testing or development
    /src/sdk        - binaries and samples that are distributed in
                      (one of) our SDKs
    /src/libs       - code for reusable native libraries
    /src/bins       - code for binaries that we ultimately ship to end users
