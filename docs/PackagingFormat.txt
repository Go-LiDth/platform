BrowserPlus packaging format

This document covers the packaging format employed by the BrowserPlus
platform for the distribution of platform updates and services.

Overview

BrowserPlus packages are nothing more than a couple conventions.
These files have an extension '.bpkg'.  A package is a LZMA compressed
tarfile containing two files:

somepkg.bpg - >
  signature.smime
  contents.tar

signature.smime is an mime representation of a signature of the
contents.tar format

contents.tar is a tarball of the contents of the package.  The
contents of contest.tar will be different for platform updates and for
services.  In both cases, the tarfile should have relative pathing
rooted at the directory into which it will be unpacked.  That is to
say, we will create a directory, change into that directory, and
unpack the contents.tar file.

Data Format

.lz is an LZMA compressed stream wrapped in header and footer which
contains a CRC32 value to ensure data integrity.  The easylzma library
(http://lloyd.github.com/easylzma) is a public domain tool which can
generate lzip format either programatically or on the command line.
Additionally, the lzip project maintains GNU Licensed command line
tools to read and write this format
(http://www.nongnu.org/lzip/lzip.html)

Note, the extension is important, as at some point we may wish to change
the compressed disk format.

Services

For services, the contents.tar file will contain the full contents of
the service.  i.e.

contents.tar.lz ->
  manifest.json
  implementation.rb
