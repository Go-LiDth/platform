do not make changes here!

the YCPUseBuildTemplates branch integrates files from the canonical home
of BuildTemplates (//ClientPlatform/Tools/BuildTemplates/...) to here.

We do integrations from that branch to pull updates to build templates.

all changes to build templates that are general should go in 
(//ClientPlatform/Tools/BuildTemplates/...) and then be integrated here.

If you have a local change you want to make to build templates that 
should not be back integrated into the main templats source, figure
out some way to do it in the cmake files that use the templates.  If you
don't have sufficient hooks, let's figure out a way to generalize
BuildTemplates so that they do what you want.
