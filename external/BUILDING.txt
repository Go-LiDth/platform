This directory contains the 3rd-party software used by BrowserPlus.  
The packages are downloaded and built by the "build.rb" scripts in 
the various subdirectories. At the top-level is a build.rb script 
which simply invokes the package build.rb scripts, as well as a 
common.rb which captures functionality needed by each build.rb script.

Prerequisites:
- ruby
  - for Windows, install from http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
- perl
  - for Windows, install from http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/  
- Visual Studio 2008 SP1 on Windows

To build:
1. cd External
2. ruby build.rb
3. wait
4. The directory Darwin or Windows is populated with the necessary build
   output.  Note that the lib subdir contains Debug and Release subdirs 
   which contain debug and release libraries.

Arguments common to all build.rb scripts:
    verbose  (default false)
        Turns on ruby verbose file operations, resulting in output when
        files are copied, moved, etc
    clean    (default false)
        Cleans build artifacts and exits
    rebuild  (default false)
        Rebuilds target(s).  By default, each build script looks for 
        one of its artifacts in {Windows|Darwin} to determine if a
        build is needed.  "rebuild" disables this check and forces
        a rebuild
    keepSource (default false)
        Causes the unpacked 3rd-party source directory to be retained
        after the build.
    -buildType=[debug|release|all]  (default all)
        Restrict the build to only debug or release bits.

If you add an external package, you must add it to the "externals" array 
in the top build.rb script and provide a package build.rb script which
fetches the package, builds it, and places results in {Windows|Darwin}.
Model your script off of an existing package script.

To build this software on windows you'll need diff.exe and patch.exe from
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/diffutils.htm and
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patchutils.htm.

NOTE: you should rename patch.exe to ptch.exe so we don't get hit with
UACs at build time.

You'll also need 7z.exe which you can get from http://www.7-zip.org
