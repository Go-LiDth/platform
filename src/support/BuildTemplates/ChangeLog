	* A fix win32 problems related to Include file generation.
	  When performing mixed mode linking using an include file,
	  the include file must not specify BT generated libraries in the
	  dependency list,  we require the client to explicitly specify
	  them which allows the freedom to link individual generated
	  libraries as static/shared.

	* add YBT_NO_HEADERS_IN_DIST which allows a client to
	  disable the copying of header files to the dist/include
	  directory (uber header included)

	* Integrate changes from //ClientPlatform/Tools/BuildTemplates	
	* YBT_PATH is no longer required to include build templates,
	  just use INCLUDE relative to CMakeLists.txt file
	* generate pdb files
	* PCH support (currently win32 only)
	* Add _REQUIRES YBT_BUILD(LIBRARY) argument for support of mixed
	  mode linking
	* use -undefined dynamic_lookup on Darwing to support mixed mode
	  linking
	* WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN now default.  disable with
	  SET(YBT_WIN32_LEAN "NO")
	* respect TARGET_LINK_DIR when XXX_LINK or XXX_REQUIRES is
	  specified.  This supports "Include file generation"
	* add YBT_GENERATE_INCLUDE_FILE public macro.  This allows one
	  to create a CMakeFile that may be included from a different
	  CMake project to export required context to use generated
	  libraries.  include paths, link directories, and library
	  dependencies
	* add YBT_NESTED_INCLUDES to support nested include directories.
	* .def, .idl, and .xpidl now included in build via implicit source
	  discovery.
	* dlls output in bin/ directory, libs in lib/ directory
	* only copy files on windows if they're different
	* YBT_PLATFORM_SEPARATOR lets clients specify an alternate string
	  for separating filename from platform when using implicit
	  source file specification.  (default is '_')
