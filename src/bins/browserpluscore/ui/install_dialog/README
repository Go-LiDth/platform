The "BrowserPlus Request" user prompt.

The prompt implemented in the HTML & JS here is displayed to the user
when they visit a site that uses browserplus.  The prompt is displayed
when require() is called by the page, effectively initializing the 
platform.

The prompt contains two classes of information, "permissions" and 
"software updates/installs".  

JS API

The platform specific native code in:
//BrowserPlus/Product/Core/Main/Browser/Common/src/UserPrompt/...
is capable of rendering this HTML inside a native window.  That same code
also exposes a couple functions that the dialog uses to access information
required to display.  A top level object is mapped into javascript,
called 'BPDialog", which exposes the following functions:

// actually display the dialog.  note that the HTML is rendered and
// javascript begins executing BEFORE the window is displayed to the
// end user.  This design allows rendering of the initial window before
// it is displayed, and also leaves the control of the ultimate dialog
// sizing up to the HTML
BPDialog.show(number height, number width);

// log information into the plugin's log.  This is a development tool.
BPDialog.log(string message);

// access the arguments to the dialog as a javascript object.
// The object is actually built up by the server.  The object today
// has the following attributes:
//  "platformUpdates" - When present, One or more browserplus platform
//                      updates.  You will only have more than one when
//                      multiple updates are available for multiple different
//                      installed major versions of the software.  This
//                      is somewhat theoretical today, but the
//                      ui should handle it.  A list of maps, map attributes
//                      are the same as for services, below.                   
//  "permissions" - A list of localized strings, permissions that the
//                  page is requesting through it's use of services.
//  "services" - a list of maps, each map contains name, version, title,
//               summary, boolean update, integer downloadSize (which is
//               zero for updates, and positive for installations)
//  "domain" - a string with the domain of the page that caused the
//             prompt (by calling require())   
Object BPDialog.args();

// A function which will cause the dialog to end, and return results in the
// form of a javascript object.  The return value is a string, one of
// form possible responses:
// Allow, AlwaysAllow, Deny, AlwaysDeny 
BPDialog.complete(Object result);
