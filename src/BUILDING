Some Influential Environmental Variables;

During build time the built BrowserPlus platform will be installed
(user-scoped) on your machine.  Certain environment variables allow
you to control how that installed version is configured:

  BP_LOG_LEVEL - one of info, debug, warn, or error.  Controls how vigorously
                 BrowserPlus logs in its logfiles.  
  BP_DISTRO_SERVERS - a comma separated list of hostnames which are the
                 distribution servers you'd like BrowserPlus to query
                 for permissions, updates, and services.

Building on OSX:
  Setting up your environment:
    1. install the latest version of XCode (at time of writing 2.5 or 3.0 for tiger/leopard)
    2. install cmake version 2.6.2 or greater from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
       Note:  If you want to use Xcode rather than make to build/debug, install cmake 2.6.x
       rather than cmake 2.8.  BrowserPlus requires backward compatibility flags and compilers
       in order to run on OSX 10.4.  In particular, we must use gcc 4.0, not gcc 4.2. 
       Unfortunately, we haven't been able to convince cmake to specify gcc 4.0 to Xcode.
       Even after running cmake, you'll need to "open BrowserPlus.xcode", File -> Get Info.  
       Then change the "C/C++ Compiler Version" from GCC 4.2 to GCC 4.0.
    3. install ruby from http://www.ruby-lang.org
 
  Building the tree:    
    1. mkdir build
    2. cd build
    3. cmake .. (or cmake -G Xcode .. to generate an xcode project)
    4. "make -j3" or "open BrowserPlus.xcodeproj"


Building on win32:
  Setting up your environment:
    1. install Visual Studio 2008 Pro or equiv and Visual Studio 2008 SP1
    2. install "Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1" from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=c17ba869-9671-4330-a63e-1fd44e0e2505
    3. run the sdk configuration tool from c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\Setup\WindowsSdkVer and set v7.0 as the current sdk
    4. (optional) Add a new user environment variable: 
          Name: WindowsSdkDir
          Value: C:\Program File\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\
       This will ensure that in cases where VS launches cmake to regenerate 
       .vcproj files, this environment variable, which is used in some of
       our cmake scripts, will be expanded properly.  
       Without this, invalid .vcproj files can be generated when cmake is 
       launched by VS.
    5. (optional) Add %WindowsSdkDir%Bin to your path.
       This will allow you to easily invoke tools such as mt.exe from your
       command line.
    6. install cmake version 2.6.2 or greater from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
          during install, select "add cmake to PATH for this user (or all users)"
    7. install ruby from http://www.ruby-lang.org
          add C:\ruby\bin to your PATH
    8. (optional) Install the latest version of doxygen if you would
       like to have documentation generated for various projects which
       do this (like ServiceAPI).  (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitiri/doxygen/)
    9. install the latest JDK from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
          ensure that JAVA_HOME is set correctly (e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_14)
   10. install the latest ANT from http://ant.apache.org
          ensure that ANT_HOME is set correctly. 
          ensure that ant binary directory is in your path (e.g. %ANT_HOME%\bin)
   11. install the latest ActivePerl: https://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads/ 
          ensure that perl is in your path from a vs command shell (you'll need this at
          least for building openssl in external/)
   12. install ptch.exe:
          get patch.exe from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patchutils.htm
          rename it to ptch.exe and put it in your path
   13. install 7z.exe into your path
          get and install it from http://www.7-zip.org

  Building the tree
    1. start a windows command prompt with visual studio env set (e.g. invoke vsvars32.bat)
    2. cd [yourdevdir]\platform\external
    3. ruby build.rb keepSource (will take a while, only needs to be done once)
    4. cd [yourdevdir]\BrowserPlus\platform\Core
    5. mkdir build
    6. cd build
    7. cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" ..
    8. devenv BrowserPlus.sln 
         or
       devenv BrowserPlus.sln /Build {Debug,Release}
         or
       Launch VS08, open build\BrowserPlus.sln and build via the gui.
