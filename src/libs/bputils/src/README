What components belong at this level?

Generally

1. os abstractions not specific to any one component in the system
2. parsing/memory management utilities needed all over

Specifically
1. utf16->utf8 conversion
2. fork/exec functionality
3. named pipe abstractions
4. json parsing library
5. url parsing
6. extract platform name/version abstraction
