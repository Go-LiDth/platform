BPUtils provides highly-generic facilities.  

To the extent possible, BrowserPlus-specific items do not appear in this lib.

In here should go facilities that are useful to *both* the BrowserPlus platform
and to BrowserPlus services.  Facilities used only by the platform should
be placed elsewhere, e.g. in platform_utils.

It is a goal to minimize this library's dependence on external projects.
