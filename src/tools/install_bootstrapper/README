Bootstrapper - this is a little binary that is a bootstrapping installer
for Win32.

Here's how it works:

1. this binary reads the last four byte of the executable file in which it's
   distributed.  Those four bytes are a little endian encoding of how much
   data is appended to the binary
2. this binary then unlzma compresses those bytes, and untars them into
   a temporary directory
3. this binary then executes a well named process inside the resultant
   tar file to conduct the installation.

the process of building an installer is appending tar/lzma data to this
bootstrap binary, then a 4 byte little endian encoding of the size of
said data.  crazy, huh?
